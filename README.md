ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am @evakimpe. I work as a researcher at Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Brussels, Belgium). In our research group, we perform studies in the field of health economics.
Currently, I am learning to use R for our health economic evaluations. I am particularly interested in packages (such as Heemod) which are specifically designed for HTA.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email (eva.kimpe@vub.be), our website (www.icher-vub.be) or my LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/eva-kimpe-594a30141/).

Warm greetings,
Eva
